# Self supervised methods

This repository contains implementation of several the most popular 
self-supervised pretraining methods of various areas of machine learning, 
including

* [computer vision](./CV/README.md) (contrastive methods, such as SimCLR, BYOL);
* [natural language](./NLP/README.md) processing (MLM, GPT, MASS);
* [speech recognition](./audio/README.md);

Also, [this](https://github.com/johanDDC/MIL_autoencoder) repository contains implementation of different autoencoders
(including MAE), which can also be interpreted as self-supervised approaches
in CV.

For more detailed description is presented in README files in corresponding 
subdirectories of this repository.
